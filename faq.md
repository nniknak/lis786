## Why do we exist?
- Friendship
- Community building
- Making bike friends in a safe space

## What kind of bike do you need to have?
Our rides welcome all forms of micromobility! We'd love to see you roll up on e-bikes, cruisers, folding bikes, mountain bikes, cargo bikes full of children & pets, gravel bikes, trikes, road bikes, scooters, or other PEVs.

## Can I bring a speaker?
We encourage bringing speakers and playing music!

## What kind of safety measures do we take?
Our marshals go through deescalation training. We have a minimum of nine marshals on each ride, and if we can't get enough Femmes & Thems-affiliated marshals, we outsource from other bike groups. Our marshals wear purple safety vests so that you can see them! Reach out if you'd like to join our team, even just occasionally.
