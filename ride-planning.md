## How to Plan F+T Group Rides

Planning a F+T Ride is not as hard as it seems if you follow these steps! Our organizers are more than happy to help you out along the way.

1. Join our Signal, Discord, and Zello Groups.
We use these apps to communicate and plan our rides.
We have a separate organizer and marshal chats.
You’ll need to join both groups to facilitate your ride.
Be sure that your phone battery is prepared to use these apps day-of. Low battery mode is a great strategy!
1. Reference our history.
Read our Google Doc of past rides, including feedback on how this ride went, good and bad, for future reference before planning.
We’ve learned a lot since our first ride and want to keep using those moments to make our rides the best they can be each month.
1. Ride Format
- First Saturday of the month: We welcome the planning of rides outside of this time frame, but we have to maintain capacity to run these rides the first week of the month as promised.
- What neighborhoods have we not ridden in recently? Have our riders requested a ride in a particular area?
- What businesses (femme/non-binary/trans/queer owned) do we want to support that can host a group of 100+ riders?
1. Confirm with organizers in the Signal chat or on Discord that your selected businesses and date/timing are good for most organizers and marshals.
1. Call the business(es) and confirm that we’re able to start/end there.
1. Get a count of available and committed marshals.
1. Work on a Canva graphic to advertise the ride on Instagram/Twitter/Facebook/Strave/community group pages.
1. Plan the route.
- Best route planning apps: Komoot, Strava
- Route should stay off of major streets and trails for the most part.
- We don’t ride through the Loop.
- Route should not have straight-aways for longer than ¾ of a mile.
- Route must cross major roads with lights or stop signs.
- Roads with one lane in either direction work well for us.
- Routes should not exceed 9-10 miles.
- Our routes don’t go the most efficient way, we take the safest and most fun routes.
- Your start and stop can be nearby as we twist and turn through the area.
1. Bring the energy day-of! You did it!
