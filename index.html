<p>A safe space for women, femme, trans, and non-binary Chicagoans to ride bikes together.</p>

<h1>Come ride with us!</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Monthly social rides are the first Saturday of every month.</li>
    <li>Night Rides happen about once a month on a weeknight.</li>
    <li>Newly added! Trans and gender diverse rides happen about once a month.</li>
    <li>Check our ride calendar or social media for details on our next ride!</li>
</ul>

<h1>What can you expect?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Rides are typically 5-7 miles at ~ 10 mph. Which you can do! Even if you are a complete beginner!</li>
    <li>We are a no drop ride! Meaning that no one gets left behind, and we do our best to help each other with mechanical issues or flat tires, making sure they are fixed before we keep pedaling.</li>
    <li>We have a team of marshals in bada** purple vests ensuring the safety of cyclists on the ride. They lead in the front, block intersections as we ride through, and secure the back of the group.</li>
</ul>
